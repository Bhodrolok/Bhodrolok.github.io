Hey there! I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Calgary. I enjoy problem-s
olving, building things and collaborating with others in a shared setting and being a part of a comm
unity that shares this passion for building innovative solutions.

As an aspiring Software Engineer and DevOps enthusiast, I love building innovative solutions from th
e ground up and automating anything (and everything!). Whether tinkering with backend systems or exp
loring bleeding edge front-end designs, I'm always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the lates
t technologies.

Apart from all that, you'll find me exploring the wonderful City of Calgary, going hiking in the Rockies and enjoying the great outdoors. I'm also a huge fan of football (BVB since 2011) and cricket (KKR since 2008)!

Thanks for stopping by!
