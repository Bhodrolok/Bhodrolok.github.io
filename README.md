🔍 Source code for my personal website 💻.

---

Built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and [Serene theme](https://github.com/isunjn/serene).

Detailed documentation for building a similar site of your own can be found [here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/) and [here](https://github.com/isunjn/serene/wiki/English-Docs).

Zola is part of the Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) _ecosystem_, which is basically a modern web development *approach* that emphasizes _pre-building_ websites and serving them as static files blazingly fast. It's pretty neat.

You can read more about Jamstack [here](https://jamstack.org/) along with a list of other Static Site Generators [here](https://jamstack.org/generators/).
